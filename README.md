## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap - CSS framework
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Added styling
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Javscript Superset
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - State management
- [Redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) - persists Redux data
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - React Bootstrap components

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - backend runtime environment
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - Node.js web framework
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - ODM for MongoDB

### What I learned

- Implement typescript in frontend and backend.
- Programmatically seeded mock data into MongoDB database.
- Unit test MongoDB, React, API, Node.js
- Integration test MongoDB
- managed state with Redux Toolkit and used its Redux Hooks to utilize it.

### Continued development

I will experiment with other ways of doing things.

- Implement React Context as state management.
- Another CSS Framework such as tailwind.css or only use SCSS.
- Serverless or use another backend such as Django, Laravel or Spring Boot.
- Styled Components
